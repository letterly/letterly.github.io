Under the Soviet Union and later under the Lukashenko regime, the Belarusian language was pushed aside in favor of the Russian language, which is used more than Belarusian in most parts of the country.

Historically, Middle Bulgarian was spoken in a much larger area in the Second Bulgarian Empire. Because of this, there are still many Bulgarian speaking towns in southern Ukraine and Moldova.

The national language and language of interethnic communication is Macedonian, a Slavic language which is related to both Serbian and Bulgarian. In terms of orthography and grammar, Macedonian is very simple compared to other languages of the region- it was codified around the late 1800s and early 1900s as the Ottoman Empire began to collapse.

Today, the Mongolian nation has been reduced to a small inland republic between Russia and China with a few million people. Due to influence from the Soviet Union, Mongolia adopted the Cyrillic alphabet to replace their traditional alphabet. The traditional alphabet, which is written top-to-bottom, is still used about Mongolians in China- but this course will only teach the Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet.</p>

Outside of Pakistan, Urdu has official status in some states in India and is spoken by the Pakistani diaspora around the world.</p>

Most Uyghurs are Muslim and therefore write in the a variant of the same alphabet of their religious texts. However, unlike the Arabic language, all vowels are fully written. There are maybe 12 million Uyghurs in northwestern China now, with an additional 2 million around the world (particularly Kazakhstan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan).</p>

In 1940 there were around 12 million speakers of Yiddish, but due to genocide and assimilation, there are only around half a million speakers today. You can help revive Yiddish and learn about its 800 years of literary tradition, the first step is for you to complete the following course:</p>

The majority are written from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system#Directionality" target="_blank">left-to-right</a>, but others such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_alphabet" target="_blank">Hebrew</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_script" target="_blank">Arabic</a> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-left_script" target="_blank">right-to-left</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_script" target="_blank">traditional Mongolian script</a> is even written top-to-bottom. Most writing systems do not differentiate between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case" target="_blank">capital and lowercase letters</a>.</p>
                    <p>While you would think most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system" target="_blank">writing systems</a> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet" target="_blank">alphabets</a>, that is systems with one symbol per sound, the most common system is actually the abugida. In an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abugida" target="_blank">abugida</a>, consonants are the letters, and the way in which they are modified indicates a vowel. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_family_of_scripts" target="_blank">Chinese script</a> is well-known for being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logogram" target="_blank">logographic system</a>; each symbol represents a word. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana" target="_blank">Japanese</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee_syllabary" target="_blank">Cherokee's</a> writing systems are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabary" target="_blank">syllabaries</a>, or systems in which each letters represents a syllable. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_script" target="_blank">Arabic</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_alphabet" target="_blank">Hebrew</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syriac_alphabet" target="_blank">Syriac</a> scripts are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad" target="_blank">abjads</a>; systems where all letters are consonants and vowels are optional/unwritten.</p>
                    <p>The most widespread writing system in the world by far is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_script" target="_blank">Latin script</a> (the one you are reading now) while the next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_writing_systems#List_of_writing_scripts_by_adoption" target="_blank">most popular</a> would be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_family_of_scripts" target="_blank">Chinese script</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script" target="_blank">Cyrillic script</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari" target="_blank">Devanagari</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_script" target="_blank">Arabic script</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali%E2%80%93Assamese_script" target="_blank">Bengali-Assamese (Eastern Nagari) script</a>.</p>
